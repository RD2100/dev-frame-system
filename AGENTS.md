# AGENTS.md

DeepSeek Harness is an all-plugin Cordis agent harness. Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing `packages/`; follow [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for documentation.

## Pre-release stance: foundation over blast radius

**Remove at the first tagged release.** Until then, prefer correct foundations to compatibility shims: rename or repackage freely and update every reference. Backends reject old on-disk formats. SQLite uses monotonic `SCHEMA_VERSION`; `dsh-session` keeps `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` at `0` with no compatibility promise.

**Application launch.** Supported Node apps launch through `dsh` profiles; package bins, demos, and public SDK argv must not bypass that launcher ([rule](docs/architecture.md#application-launch)).

```

### Shared checkout validation

Before a command that writes shared build outputs, agree on one build owner and the command/output paths in the active task handoff or conversation; other tasks reuse matching evidence or defer that command. Recheck target-file content before edits. Do not start overlapping Host/website/lib builds, interrupt another task's processes, or build solely for read-only prose review. Use [dsh-doc validation](.agents/skills/dsh-doc/SKILL.md#validation) to select checks and record evidence validity.

### Host sandbox failures

If a required command fails because the sandbox blocks credentials, network, IPC, watching, or nested `sandbox-exec`, retry unchanged with the narrowest permitted host escalation. If escalation is unavailable, report it; never bypass test failures or the product sandbox.

### Run relevant checks locally

Run checks before pushes via [dsh-pre-push-checks](.agents/skills/dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md); report only commands run. After `gh stack sync`, validate immediately; do not merge before checks pass.

- Match evidence to the surface: focused behavior tests, model/user-output snapshots, [affected-format checks](.agents/skills/dsh-doc/SKILL.md#validation) for docs, built smokes for published paths, and real-API e2e for providers.
- Never default to the full suite or repeat a passing check for commit or push. CI owns exhaustive coverage and the platform matrix; rehearse all locally only by explicit request, for CI diagnosis, or for an irreducibly repository-wide change.
- `test:coverage`, not `test`, is the CI coverage gate ([why](docs/testing.md)).

## Secrets / .env

Real-API tests and demos read `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, optional `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, and root `.env`. cordis.yml allows `!!js` (never `!js`) under plugin `config` and entry `disabled`; other metadata stays literal, so conditional composition also uses overlays ([primer](docs/cordis-primer.md#loader-configuration)). Never commit credentials. CI e2e skips without a key; [testing.md](docs/testing.md) owns key policy.

## Conventions

- Every npm package is `@deepseek-ai/dsh-<name>`; vendored packages are rescoped ([mapping](docs/rescope.md)) and `private: true`. `@deepseek-ai/cordis` is a peerDependency (+ dev) of every harness package.
- **ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`).** Use package names across packages and `.ts` in local relative imports. Built config subprocesses run plain Node; source launchers follow [testing policy](docs/testing.md#test-subprocess-launch-modes). The `dsh` source CLI uses `node --import tsx/esm`; reachable modules stay ESM ([source-launch contract](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-29-dsh-source-launch-tsx-esm.md)). Raw/Web `cordis.yml` bare plugins must appear in their resolver manifest's `dependencies`; `verify-cordis-config` enforces it.
- **Registrations are effects**: every contribution goes through `ctx.effect()` / `ctx.on()`; a registry's `register()` returns the disposer.
- **Runtime invariants assert owned relationships.** Publish `./invariant` only when independent observations can diverge; otherwise follow the [package invariant rules](packages/AGENTS.md).
- **Typed events use declaration merging** and merge-extensible maps. Event JSDoc needs `@mode` and payload `@param`; scoped keys absent from payloads need `@dshScopeScan unsupported`. Public service methods document parameters and non-void returns. Unknown `SessionEventMap` types require the envelope's `ignorable: true`; only structural format changes bump `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` ([mechanism](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-10-session-log-version-mechanism.md)).
- **Switch on discriminant tags.** Closed unions end in `assertNever`; merge-extensible unions fall through a documented default.
- **Waterfall listeners call `next()` when delegating;** omit it for an intentional short-circuit ([semantics](docs/cordis-primer.md#cordis-waterfall-semantics)).
- **Model-visible ⟺ logged**: anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the session log; a new model-visible input requires a session event.
- **Plugins, not loop changes**: new behavior goes on documented extension points; changing `agent-loop` requires updating docs/architecture.md.
- **A capability seam includes Service Definition, Provider, and Consumer roles;** split only when roles evolve independently ([glossary](docs/glossary.md#capability-seam)).
- **Prefer maintained dependencies over hand-rolling** when they genuinely delete owned code and tests ([policy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-dependencies-over-hand-rolling.md)).
- **Resolve defaults explicitly at package boundaries:** use `resolve(request): Spec`, not a hidden `?? default` inside `run()` (the `dsh-shell` request/spec split is the template).
- **No hardcoded tunables in plugins**: deployment-varying choices are validated `Config` fields changeable from cordis.yml; a `DEFAULT_*` constant or test hook is not configurability. Protocol constants, external specs, and security invariants stay fixed.
- **Misconfiguration fails loud** at load when self-contained, otherwise at the earliest resolvable point; never silently skip a missing referent.
- **Opaque cross-boundary ids are branded** (`Branded<B>` from `dsh-brand`), never bare `string`.
- **Trust TypeScript at typed same-process boundaries.** Do not add runtime validation, fallback behavior, or hostile-input tests solely for values the static interface requires; validate at parser/config, queued, model/tool JSON, durable/file, worker, process, and wire boundaries.
- **Keep source and artifact planes separate.** Static gates and tests use tsconfig `paths` to `src` and pass on a clean tree; gates consuming built `lib/` declare that dependency ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **Keep compiler faces explicit.** Host/Client packages use face-specific leaves and a solution-only root; repo-wide programs seed a face config, never the root solution ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **An empty `catch` names what it swallows** and why nothing else can reach it; keep the `try` to one statement.
- **Keep comments local.** Do not restate code, explain distant behavior unless locally required, or expand unrelated comments ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-09-concrete-prose-names-actors-and-recorded-facts.md)).
- **Prefer symmetry for parallel values** when their behavior is symmetric; document intentional differences.
- **Tests describe behavior, not correctness.** Change obsolete behavior with its tests; explain why in the PR.
- **Non-trivial changes include an Agent Note in the same PR;** purely mechanical/local edits are exempt ([scope](.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)). Archived notes are frozen ([archive policy](.agents/notes/README.md#archiving-and-deletion)).
- **Client UI copy is locale-owned.** Route product text through typed dictionaries and `t` or localized primitive props; `verify-client-ui-i18n` rejects hardcoded copy ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-23-locale-owned-client-ui-copy.md)).
- **Testing policy** — [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) owns tiers and snapshot placement. Every non-trivial model-, protocol-, or product-visible change updates a keyless recorded-session scenario; agent-loop, session-lifecycle, and `SessionEventMap` changes update both SDK projections.
- **Tool UI and coverage:** keep host presenters pure; derive Web cards from raw events and persisted result metadata. Select the smallest applicable unit, e2e, or snapshot evidence for new seams, lifecycle paths, and transcript variants ([cookbook](docs/cookbook/adding-a-tool.md)).
- **History rewrites use leases.** Split independent changes; use `--force-with-lease`, never raw `--force`, and revalidate after `gh stack sync` ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-02-native-github-stacks-and-optional-rebases.md)).
- **Labels:** one PR `kind/*`, all material `area/*`, and native Issue Type ([taxonomy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-08-unified-github-label-taxonomy.md)).
- TODO markers: `FIXME`/`TODO`/`XXX` by urgency ([semantics](docs/development.md)).
- Files end with exactly one trailing newline; `git diff --cached --check` (pre-commit) gates it.

## Defensive patterns

Read [docs/defensive-patterns.md](docs/defensive-patterns.md) before lifecycle, concurrency, subprocess, or teardown work.

## Type safety and documentation

Everything compiles under `strict: true` with `noImplicitAny`; every remaining `any` explains why narrowing is infeasible. Every module and export has concise JSDoc for its non-obvious contract; function-like exports include `@param`/`@returns`, as enforced by `verify-export-jsdoc`. Heritage-declared members, plugin-protocol slots, and constructors keep their docs at the declaring Service Definition, protocol, or class.

Comments and docs preserve non-obvious behavior, failure, timing, ownership, and safe-use contracts; omit code restatement and reasoning transcripts. Use direct, concrete terms and link rationale. Apply [dsh-prose-standard](.agents/skills/dsh-prose-standard/SKILL.md) for editorial decisions. When adding or changing a mechanically checkable invariant, wire it into an executed top-level gate and cover each changed acceptance path with an invalid case; use narrow, justified exceptions.

When documented behavior or obligations change, update the owning README and JSDoc. Follow [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for bilingual pairs, one-home placement, physical-line wrapping, and budgets; run `dsh-translate-docs` only when explicitly requested.

## Editing these instructions

`CLAUDE.md` symlinks `AGENTS.md` at root and `packages/`; edit the real file. Keep each rule self-contained while linking high-level docs. Condense when clarity survives; raise a `verify-doc-budgets` ceiling when the required content genuinely needs more space.

## Vendoring policy

`vendor/` packages are pinned source copies (manifest with upstream SHAs in [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md)). Update via the sync procedure there; re-apply or retire the logged local modifications; rerun `pnpm run test && pnpm run build`.
